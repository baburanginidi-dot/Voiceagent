this is a classic Audio Overlap (Race Condition) issue. It sounds like two instances of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine are firing simultaneously, or a new response is starting before the previous one was silenced.
Here is the technical diagnosis and the specific code fixes to resolve this.
The Diagnosis
In the video, at 0:14, the AI says "Nen Maya..." while another instance of the voice is already speaking. This usually happens for one of three reasons:
React Strict Mode: In development (replit.dev), React renders components twice to check for side effects. If your audio plays on "mount," it will play twice.
No "Kill Switch": The system receives a new audio chunk but fails to pause() or cancel() the previous audio track before playing the new one.
Double Event Trigger: The "Start Session" or Mic button is triggering the API call twice (e.g., once on mousedown and once on mouseup, or no debounce).
The Scope of Work to Fix It
1. The "Kill Switch" (Immediate Fix)
You must enforce a rule: "Only one audio source can exist at a time." Before playing any new sound, the system must aggressively silence the previous one.
Code Logic (Conceptual):
code
JavaScript
let currentAudio = null;

function playResponse(audioBlob) {
    // STEP 1: KILL THE GHOST
    if (currentAudio) {
        currentAudio.pause();
        currentAudio.currentTime = 0; // Reset to start
        currentAudio = null;
    }

    // STEP 2: PLAY THE NEW
    currentAudio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob));
    currentAudio.play();
}
2. Fix React Strict Mode (Development Issue)
Since you are on Replit (Development environment), React StrictMode often causes effects to run twice.
Check your index.js or main.tsx:
Action: If you see <React.StrictMode>, temporarily comment it out to see if the double voice stops. If it stops, your useEffect hooks need a cleanup function.
The Fix in useEffect:
code
JavaScript
useEffect(() => {
    const audio = new Audio(src);
    audio.play();

    // CLEANUP FUNCTION IS MANDATORY
    return () => {
        audio.pause();
        audio.currentTime = 0;
    };
}, [src]);
3. Implement "Barge-In" Logic (Interruption)
If the user speaks while the bot is talking, the bot must shut up immediately. Currently, it seems the bot keeps talking even if a new state is triggered.
Task: Ensure that the socket.on('user_speaking') event triggers the Kill Switch defined in step 1.
4. Button Debounce
The "Start Session" button might be sending two requests if the user double-clicks or if the event listener is sensitive.
Task: Disable the button immediately after the first click.
code
JavaScript
<button 
  onClick={handleStart} 
  disabled={isConnecting} // Disable button while connecting
>
  Start Session
</button>
Summary for your Developer
"The audio playback queue is not clearing correctly. Please implement a global audio manager that forces audio.pause() on the current track before any new track begins. Also, check if React Strict Mode is causing double-mounting of the audio player component."
